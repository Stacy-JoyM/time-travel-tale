The world around Ava flickered, then stilled. 
One moment, she had been standing in the bustling city square, the hum of modern life buzzing in her ears. The next, an eerie silence pressed in, and the air seemed thicker, as if history itself had shifted its weight. 
She took a breath and opened her eyes, expecting to see familiar skyscrapers towering overhead. 
Instead, cobblestone streets stretched before her, and horses clopped by in the distance.
Time had let her slip through its fingers, and she had landed in a world not her own.
