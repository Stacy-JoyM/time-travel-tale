The world around Ava flickered, then stilled. 
One moment, she had been standing in the bustling city square, the hum of modern life buzzing in her ears. The next, an eerie silence pressed in, and the air seemed thicker, as if history itself had shifted its weight. 
She took a breath and opened her eyes, expecting to see familiar skyscrapers towering overhead. 
Instead, cobblestone streets stretched before her, and horses clopped by in the distance.
Time had let her slip through its fingers, and she has landed in a world not her own.

Future 
Ava stood at the edge of the shimmering skyline, the city stretching out before her like a gleaming mosaic of glass and steel.
It was a world she barely recognized, where soaring skyscrapers pierced through the clouds and vehicles glided silently above the 
streets, powered by technology that defied her understanding. The air buzzed with a harmonious hum of advanced machinery, and holographic displays floated seamlessly alongside towering digital billboards.
